        <h2>I Want to Learn Programming but I Don’t Know where to Start</h2>
        <p>Top Programming Languages: If you’re looking for an official ranking of the top programming languages, you can find it here: IEEE Spectrum top programming languagesThat list is great for checking whether a particular programming language is in use today. However, if you’re new to programming, I don’t recommend choosing a language solely based on a list.</p>
        <p>Computer science is an entirely cumulative field of study. That means, each successive topic builds off prior topics.</p>
        <p>If you have previously attempted to learn programming (or any STEM field) in school, tried your best, but failed — you weren’t the problem. A good professor of any cumulative subject carefully curates the curriculum. Provided that each student has sufficiently prepared and satisfied the prerequisites, the expectations for the students’ prior knowledge should be clear. A good professor understands the expectations and assumes no knowledge beyond that scope. Anything outside of the expectations must be taught. Each topic in the curriculum is ordered sequentially, respective to the other topics.</p>
        <p>When a subject is cumulative, meticulous attention must be paid when designing a course curriculum or learning path. With that said, don’t choose a language for its ranking; choose a language for which you have a complete learning path that makes no assumptions about prior knowledge</p>
        <p>A FEW WORDS OF ADVICE: Before you begin learning how to code, it’s important to reflect on the point I made above: everything in computer science is cumulative.I like to reiterate this because the biggest mistake you can make as an aspiring programmer is giving up because you don’t think you’re smart enough to learn programming. Learning to code has nothing to do with your intelligence. Yes, it’s difficult to learn programming, not because of who you are, but because there are a lot of topics to learn.</p>
        <p>One last piece of advice: never underestimate the power of memorization. Memorization is a totally underutilized approach in learning. Yes, comprehension of a topic is the ultimate goal. However, comprehension may take time. If you are really struggling to grasp a topic, break down the topic and memorize the important terms. If you can’t comprehend how something works, your immediate goal should be memorization. If you need tips on how to tackle memorization, consider using the study card technique.</p>
