        <h2>5 Things Java Programmers should Learn in 2020</h2>
        <p>1. Docker and Kubernetes :<br>
You’ve probably heard the buzz around Docker and Kubernetes and the impact it has on DevOps teams. You may have at first thought, "ahh, yet another new technology I need to learn", but I will say that Docker is not just another technology but its truly a game-changer.

Along with Kubernetes, It’s one of the most important tools that you can learn and will stay with you throughout your entire career.

Nowadays, Docker and Kubernetes are used by almost every development team, whether it’s a large enterprise or a small startup. It’s safe to say that if you’re entering the workforce now, you’ll most likely brush up against Docker at some point.

In short, whether you are a junior Java developer or an experienced veteran of several years of experience, Having Docker and Kubernetes knowledge is essential for your career progression and job change. If you have already realized the importance of Kubernetes and looking to learn Kubernetes in 2020 then Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide by Stephen Grider on Udemy is an excellent course to start with
        </p>
        <p>2. Git :<br>

Git and Github have been around some time, and while I have used Git in the past with Eclipse, I am yet to become comfortable with Git on the command line.

Why I haven't mastered Git so far? Simply because I didn't need it yet. I have occasionally download projects from Github and run from Eclipse, but I am still a novice with Git.




Since now, most of the companies are migrating their projects from SVN, CVS to Git, its high time to learn and master Git. I have recently purchased the Git Complete: The definitive, step-by-step guide to Git from Udemy on their last 10$ sale, and this would be the first item to complete in 2020. If you are in the same boat and want to learn Git in 2020, do check out that course from Udemy, it's convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Unit testing (JUnit and Mockito) :<br>
Another area which I want to improve in the coming year. There are a lot of new frameworks and tools available for Java programmers to unit test, and integration tests their application, e.g., Mockito and PowerMock for mocking objects, Robot Framework, and Cucumber for automated integration test and of course the new and shining JUnit 5 library.

There is plenty of stuff to learn on this front. If you can invest some time upgrading your unit testing skill, not only your coding expertise will improve, but also you will become a more professional developer, which every company looks form. To start with, you can check out the JUnit and Mockito Crash Course from Udemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. New Java Features from JDK 9 to 13 :<br>

As I have said in the past, I am still struggling to catch up with six-monthly Java releases and many Java developers too. I have spent some time learning new features of Java 9, 10, 11, and 12 this year, but for me, Java 11 is still a priority until I moved to Java 13, which is an LTS release.

The JDK 9 brings a lot of goodies in terms of modules, Jigsaw, Reactive Streams, Process API, HTTP2 client, JShell, and API improvements like collection factory methods, and I am really looking forward to learning them at the earliest opportunity.




Similarly, JDK 10 brings var to give you a flavor of dynamic typing and some GC improvement. Then you have Text Blocks and String in switch case from JDK 12 and JDK 13.
</p>
  <p>
    5. DevOps (Jenkins)<br>
This is another area where I am seeing a lot of traction last year as more and more companies are moving into DevOps and adopting continuous integration and deployment.

DevOps is very vast, and you need to learn a lot of tools and principles, and that's what overwhelm many developers, but you don't need to worry. I have shared a DevOps RoadMap, which you can follow to learn and master DevOps, particularly Jenkins at your own speed.

This means if you are an experienced Java programmer with a passion for managing the environment, automation, and improving overall structure, you can become a DevOps Engineer.
