        <h2>How can coding change the World</h2>
        <p>1. Conquering Space<br>
Margaret Hamilton was a young, plucky, 33-year old woman with glasses who liked math. She was one of the few women at MIT’s Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, which in the early 1960’s, was developing something important for NASA. <br>

The Apollo and Skylab programs would mark a new era in space exploration. Hamilton led the team that developed the in-flight software used to control the Apollo command module, lunar lander, and eventually, the world’s first space station, Skylab.<br>

At a time when there were no computer science courses or software engineers, Hamilton was self-taught. Developing her skills with hands-on experience, she designed and developed recovery systems and error detection software. Her amazing efforts left fellow team-members dumbfounded

      2. A Window to the World<br>
William Henry Gates III - better known to the world as Bill - was born in October of 1955. By the time he was 13, he was fascinated by computers and took advantage of programs at his school to get access to the school’s computer systems. <br>

He wrote games likes tic-tac-toe in BASIC and later, when he demonstrated his expertise in programming, was enlisted to help a contractor for his school develop payroll programs and class scheduling software. <br>
In his words, it was “hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.”

Eventually, he would take his programming knowledge and use it to capitalize on a new technology that was quickly spreading across the globe—personal computers.

His idea was simple: Don’t make the machines, but make the software that runs them. <br>
He went on to form Microsoft. The company would release Microsoft Windows, a graphical interface for MS-DOS on November 20, 1985.

    3. From Dungeons and Demons to Steve<br>
Of the many types of video games created over the years, you’re bound to see a few that are a little off-center.
<br>
The 1997 Electronic Arts classic Dungeon Keeper is an odd one. An interesting switch on the classic dungeon crawler, the game puts you in the role of a dungeon master - of sorts - placing obstacles and building dungeons to protect your precious creation from invading heroes.
<br>
Then there is Dwarf Fortress, a freeware game, with three game modes, all of which take place in worlds created by the player. The game’s Fortress mode is a construction and management sim, while Adventure mode is a turn-based adventure game. The Legends mode showcases player achievements.
<br>
Finally, Infiniminer was is a 3D isometric building game, which feels a lot like a familiar block-building game that many kids know and love today.

<p>8. The Queen of Code<br>
Like most Americans during the time, Grace Hopper wanted to give her all for her country and fight in the big one—World War II. So at 34 years old she tried to enlist in the Navy, but was turned away because she was told that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was far more valuable to the war effort.
<br>
Undeterred, Grace Hopper did what any young lady with moxie would have done at the time: she got a leave of absence from Vassar and volunteered for the United States Navy Reserve.
<br>
After training at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School, Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944. She went on to work for the Navy at Harvard University and served on the Mark I computer programming project. She liked the work so much, she remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar to work as a research fellow under Navy contract.
<br>
Known for her persistence, she spent the 1960’s surrounded by computers. One day, Grace recalls, “I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say "Subtract income tax from pay" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.”
<br>
It was a watershed event: making computer programming accessible with a programming language that was written in English. It took years for her ideas to be accepted by her peers. But when it was finally adopted, COBOL was the first computer language that used words, not numbers, to run computers. Today COBOL is, as Grace put it, “The major language used today in data processing." (Learn more about kids coding languages.)
